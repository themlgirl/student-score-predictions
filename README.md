# 📊 Student Score Prediction - Linear Regression from Scratch

This project predicts a student's score based on the number of hours studied using **Linear Regression** — built entirely from scratch using only **NumPy** and **Matplotlib** (no ML libraries like scikit-learn!).

## 🚀 What This Project Covers

- Manual implementation of:
  - Hypothesis Function (y = mx + b)
  - Mean Squared Error (Cost Function)
  - Gradient Descent Optimization
- Visualization of:
  - Cost over training iterations
  - Best-fit regression line
- Simple dataset: Hours Studied vs Marks Scored

## 📁 Dataset

We used a small, manually created dataset:

```text
Hours:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Scores: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
